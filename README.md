Hi, my name is [Suneel Seela] and 4.5 years of  erience in software testing, primarily focused on automation testing using Selenium with Python.

In my current/previous role, I’ve been responsible for designing and maintaining automation frameworks, writing reusable test scripts, and ensuring the quality of web applications across multiple releases. I have strong experience in test case design, execution, debugging, and integrating with CI/CD pipelines.

In addition to automation, I also have hands-on experience in AWS support, including EC2, S3, IAM, and monitoring services. I’ve supported cloud-based test environments and helped in maintaining infrastructure reliability.

I’m passionate about delivering high-quality products and continuously improving testing efficiency through automation and DevOps practices. I'm now looking for opportunities where I can contribute my skills and grow further in both automation and cloud technologies.
